## 🔭 At a glance

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 📦 **Everything in one place** | One repository and one config for the whole desktop. Beyond Hyprland and Quickshell, the only requirements are `python3` and `jq`. |
| 🎛️ **Configured from the desktop** | A Settings page generated from the schema, plus live editors for the bar and the overlay. Changes hot-reload. |
| 🛡️ **Built not to break** | An invalid config never replaces the running one. Old configs migrate themselves, and API keys stay out of `config.json`. |
| 🎨 **One theme everywhere** | Base16 themes, or one generated from your wallpaper, applied to 18 other apps. |
| 🤝 **Fits your setup** | Three Hyprland modes and three lockscreen modes. Your own config files are never edited. |
| 🖥️ **Multi-monitor** | Bars and wallpapers per monitor. Surfaces open on the primary monitor, the focused one, or all of them. |

## ✨ Features

### 📊 Bar
- Bars are defined in config. You can have any number, on any monitor and any edge. Each one can be solid, transparent, or split into floating pills.
- 20 widget types: Workspaces, Window, Time, Media, Volume, Microphone, Network, Bluetooth, Battery, SystemStats, SystemTray, Notifications, Updates, Weather, Tailscale, KeyboardLayout, IdleInhibitor, Privacy, Button (runs any command) and Separator.
- Popouts grow out of the bar, or out of the screen border, with filleted corners. Widgets open theirs on hover:
  - a calendar
  - the audio mixer
  - Bluetooth and Wi-Fi menus
  - live system graphs
  - the forecast
  - pending updates, and more

  Buttons can run their action on hover too.

### 🗂️ Overlay
- A full-screen overlay made of pages of cards. Each page is built from columns, each column from cells, and each cell holds modules.
- 24 modules, including:
  - a media player, audio mixer, system graphs and top processes
  - disks, updates, quick toggles, Bluetooth, network and Wi-Fi networks
  - weather, calendar, notes and favourites
  - screenshot, session controls, a workspace map and AI chat
- Modules adapt to the shape of their slot (square, wide, tall or quarter).
- Built-in pages:
  - **Settings**, generated from the config schema
  - **Bar editor**
  - **Overlay editor**
  - **Themes**
  - **Keybinds**

### 🎨 Theming
- Base16 themes, with dark and light pairs switched by one toggle: Catppuccin, Gruvbox, Solarized, Tokyo Night/Day and Submarine Sonar.
- Generate a theme from your wallpaper. pywal backends pick the candidate colors, then the palette is built in OKLCH to match the contrast of the hand-made themes.
- Wallpapers can be set per monitor, with transitions through [awww](https://github.com/LGFae/awww).
- The active theme is applied to other apps too. Each app is a switch under **Settings → Theme integrations**, gets its own `axiom` theme file, and its switch's description gives the one line to add to its config. Your own config files are never edited.

<details>
<summary><b>Supported apps (18)</b></summary>

| Kind | Apps |
| --- | --- |
| Toolkits | GTK, Qt |
| Terminals | kitty, Alacritty, foot, WezTerm, Ghostty |
| Editors | Neovim, Helix, VS Code |
| CLI tools | k9s, cava, btop, fzf, lazygit, bat/delta, Yazi |
| Lockscreen | hyprlock |

</details>

### 🧩 The rest
- 🔔 **Notifications:** toasts and a notification center.
- 🔊 **OSD:** follows the volume of the apps you choose.
- 🚀 **Launcher:** searches apps (ranked by how often and how recently you use them), open windows, a calculator and the web. It runs shell commands and controls the shell with `/` commands.
- ⏻ **Power menu:** asks you to confirm.
- 🧭 **Workspaces:** laid out as 1 to N, or as a grid per monitor (5×5 by default) that you move around by row and column. The bar widget, the workspace map, the workspace overlay and your keybinds (through the `workspaces` IPC target) all follow the one setting.
- 🪟 **Workspace overlay:** live window previews. Drag a window onto a side of another window or onto another workspace, right-drag to resize it, and middle-click to close it.
- 🤖 **AI chat:** Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic or an offline backend. API keys are read from environment variables or a secrets file with mode 600, never from `config.json`.
- 🔒 **Lockscreen:** three modes: the built-in `ext-session-lock` locker (PAM), a themed hyprlock config that axiom generates, or none.
- 🖥️ **Multi-monitor:** interactive surfaces open on the primary monitor, or on whichever monitor has focus.
- 🌐 **Translations:** English and Japanese, with more added as a single JSON file each.

## 📋 Requirements

The whole shell runs on four things. Everything else is optional and only needed for the feature that uses it.

**Required**
- Hyprland 0.55 or newer, with its Lua config (`hyprland.lua`)
- [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org) 0.3.1 or newer (`qs`)
- A Nerd Font (`Symbols Nerd Font`) for icons
- `jq`, `python3`

<details open>
<summary><b>Optional</b>, for the features that use them</summary>

| Feature | Needs |
| --- | --- |
| Wallpapers | `awww` |
| Theme generation | ImageMagick (`magick` or `convert`). The Python packages are installed into `.venv` automatically from `scripts/requirements.txt` |
| Network widget / module, Wi-Fi menu | NetworkManager (`nmcli`), and Quickshell built with its Networking module |
| Updates | `pacman-contrib` (`checkupdates`), plus `paru` or `yay` for AUR updates |
| Tailscale | `tailscale` |
| Screenshot module | `grim`, `slurp`, `wl-copy` |
| Launcher calculator | `qalc` (libqalculate), `wl-copy` |
| NVIDIA GPU stats | `nvidia-smi` (AMD is read from sysfs) |
| hyprlock mode | `hyprlock`, and `hypridle` to lock on idle |
| Theme integrations | The app itself (`kitty`, `alacritty`, `foot`, `wezterm`, `ghostty`, `nvim`, `helix`/`hx`, VS Code or VSCodium, `k9s`, `cava`, `btop`, `fzf` 0.49+, `lazygit`, `bat`, `yazi` 25.5+); `qt5ct`/`qt6ct` for Qt; `adw-gtk-theme` for GTK3 apps |

</details>

## 🚀 Installation

There's no installer yet. Clone into Quickshell's config directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axiom-dotfiles/axiom.git ~/.config/quickshell/axiom
```

Start it from your Hyprland config (`hyprland.lua`):

```lua
hl.on("hyprland.start", function() hl.exec_cmd("qs -c axiom") end)
```

That's all Hyprland needs. How axiom sets up the rest is **Settings → Desktop → Hyprland → Mode**:

| Mode | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Detached** (default) | Applies axiom's keybinds and required settings at runtime, and again after every Hyprland reload. It writes no files, and skips any keybind whose key your config already uses. |
| **Included** | Writes `~/.local/state/axiom/hyprland.lua` (under `$XDG_STATE_HOME` if it's set). Load it near the top of your `hyprland.lua`, and anything after it overrides axiom (see below). |
| **Managed** | axiom writes `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua` itself, from the **Managed config** settings (layout, gaps, borders, input). It then loads your own `~/.config/hypr/user/*.lua` after it, in name order, as `require("user.<name>")`, so Hyprland reloads when one changes. Shared modules go in `user/lib/`, which isn't loaded on its own. `user/` itself may be a symlink, for example into a dotfiles repo. The first time, your old `hyprland.lua` is backed up and moved to `user/00-previous.lua`. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Managed mode never takes over a `~/.config/hypr` that is a symlink or in a git repository.

For the included mode, add:

```lua
local ok, axiom = pcall(dofile, os.getenv("HOME") .. "/.local/state/axiom/hyprland.lua")
if ok then axiom.setup() end
```

> [!TIP]
> `setup()` applies everything switched on in the settings. To pick parts yourself, call `axiom.required()`, `axiom.binds()`, `axiom.theme()` and `axiom.blur()` instead. `hl.unbind("KEY")` after it frees one of axiom's keys.

Whichever mode is set, axiom falls back to the runtime layer when its file isn't loaded, and logs why.

The same settings page holds switches for:
- **required settings:** `misc.allow_session_lock_restore`, and a `workspaces` animation for the grid's slides
- **theme-coloured window borders**
- **blur behind axiom's surfaces**
- **starting `awww-daemon`**

Keybinds are edited on the **Keybinds** page. A bind can run any IPC action below, or a command. A description like `Workspace: Switch left` puts the bind in its own section on that page.

The [hypr](https://github.com/axiom-dotfiles/hypr) repository has a matching Hyprland config.

## ⌨️ Keybinds and IPC

Every surface can be controlled over Quickshell IPC, so you can bind it to anything:

```bash
qs -c axiom ipc call <target> <function>
```

<details>
<summary><b>IPC targets</b></summary>

| Target | Functions |
| --- | --- |
| `overlay` | `open`, `close`, `toggle`, `page <type>` |
| `appLauncher` | `open`, `close`, `toggle`, `search <text>` |
| `powermenu` | `open`, `close`, `toggle` |
| `workspaceOverlay` | `show`, `hide`, `toggle` |
| `workspaces` | `go <id>`, `move <id>`, `moveSilent <id>`, `left`, `right`, `up`, `down`, `step <direction> <mode>`, `nth <n> <mode>` |
| `idleInhibit` | `enable`, `disable`, `toggle`, `status` |
| `lockscreen` | `lock` |
| `notifications` | `clear`, `toggleDnd` |

</details>

If you bind them in your own `hyprland.lua` instead of through axiom's settings, it looks like this. A `"Section: Label"` description sets where the bind appears on the Keybinds page:

```lua
hl.bind("SUPER + SPACE", hl.dsp.exec_cmd("qs -c axiom ipc call appLauncher toggle"), { description = "Axiom: App launcher" })
hl.bind("SUPER + T", hl.dsp.exec_cmd("qs -c axiom ipc call appLauncher search '/theme '"), { description = "Axiom: Themes" })
```

### 🚀 Launcher

Plain text searches apps and open windows. When the text is math, the result shows first, and a web search comes last. A prefix picks one kind of search:

| Prefix | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Shell commands (list below) |
| `=` | Calculator (qalc: math, units, currencies). Enter copies the result |
| `>` | Runs a shell command. Shift+Enter runs it in your terminal |
| `?` | Web search, with the engine set in Settings |

<kbd>Tab</kbd> completes a command or its argument. Commands that change something you can see, like the theme, volume or wallpaper, keep the launcher open, so you can try several. `logout`, `reboot` and `poweroff` ask for a second <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

| Group | Commands |
| --- | --- |
| **Session** | `/lock` `/suspend` `/hibernate` `/logout` `/reboot` `/poweroff` `/power` |
| **Pages** | `/overlay [page]` `/settings` `/themes` `/bar` `/keybinds` `/editor` `/workspaces` |
| **Look** | `/theme <name>` `/dark` `/light` `/mode` `/wallpaper <file\|Random>` `/generate` |
| **Audio and media** | `/volume <n\|+n\|-n>` `/mute` `/mic` `/output <device>` `/input <device>` `/play` `/next` `/prev` |
| **Connectivity** | `/wifi [on\|off]` `/bluetooth [on\|off]` `/connect <device>` |
| **Other** | `/dnd [on\|off]` `/clear` `/caffeine [on\|off]` `/ws <n>` `/config <setting> <value>` `/config save <name>` `/config restore <name>` `/reload` `/help` |

Every provider can be switched off under **Settings › Desktop › Launcher**. The same page sets:
- the launcher's size, hidden apps, terminal and search engine
- where it opens: floating (centered or in the upper third), or attached to the top or bottom edge like the other edge popouts
- whether the search field sits above or below the results

### 🔒 Locking with hypridle

For the `quickshell` and `hyprlock` lockscreen modes:

```ini
general {
    lock_cmd = qs -c axiom ipc call lockscreen lock
    before_sleep_cmd = loginctl lock-session
}
```

In `none` mode axiom doesn't register the `lockscreen` target. Point hypridle at your own locker, and set **Lockscreen → Lock command** so that axiom's lock buttons run it too.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Everything is configured from inside the shell. Open the overlay, and use the **Settings**, **Bar editor**, **Overlay editor** and **Themes** pages.

- Settings are saved to `config/user/config.json`. The shell watches that file and reloads when it changes, so editing it by hand also works.
- Configs from older versions are migrated automatically.
- `config/json/config.schema.json` defines every option and its default. It also generates the Settings page.
- Chat API keys are read from `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. If those aren't set, they come from `$XDG_STATE_HOME/axiom/secrets.json`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An invalid `config.json` never replaces the running config. The shell keeps the last good one and refuses to save until the file is fixed.

### 🎨 Themes

- Hand-made themes live in `config/themes/`, and generated ones in `config/themes/generated/`.
- A theme is a base16 palette (`base00`–`base0F`) plus optional semantic overrides. See `config/themes/theme.schema.json`.
- To add a theme, drop a JSON file in `config/themes/`. To make a dark/light pair, give each file a `paired` field naming the other.

### 🌐 Translations

- Pick a language in **Settings → General → Language**.
- To add a language, create `config/i18n/<code>.json` (see `ja.json`). It shows up in the dropdown right away.
- Missing strings fall back to English. `scripts/check_i18n.py` reports what's missing.

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

View the shell's log with:

```bash
scripts/log.sh          # warnings and errors since the last reload
scripts/log.sh --debug  # include console.log output
scripts/log.sh -f       # follow
```

A clean reload prints only `Reloading configuration...` and `Configuration Loaded`.

## 🤝 Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the directory layout and conventions, and [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the architecture in detail. There's no build step: `qs` interprets the QML and hot-reloads on save.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Onboarding and a setup wizard
- [ ] Installer / AUR package
- [ ] More translations
- [ ] CI, plus issue and pull request templates
- [ ] First stable release, after which changes land through PRs only
